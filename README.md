# ‚ù§Ô∏è Heart Disease Prediction

This project predicts the likelihood of heart disease in a patient based on various health parameters such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol level, and more.  
It uses **Machine Learning** to analyze the data and provide predictions.

## üìå Goals of the Project

1. **Understand the Dataset**
   - Explore and clean the heart disease dataset.
   - Identify important features related to heart disease.

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handle missing values.
   - Normalize or scale the data for better model performance.
   - Encode categorical variables (if any).

3. **Model Building**
   - Apply machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.).
   - Train and evaluate models using metrics like **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-score**.

4. **Model Comparison**
   - Compare the performance of different ML models.
   - Select the best-performing model for prediction.

5. **Prediction**
   - Use the trained model to predict whether a patient is at risk of heart disease based on input health parameters.

6. **Visualization**
   - Plot graphs to better understand:
     - Feature correlation with heart disease.
     - Model accuracy and performance.
     - Data distribution.
